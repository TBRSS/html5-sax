HTML5-SAX is a replacement for [CHTML][chtml]. It bridges
[CL-HTML5-PARSER][html5] and [CXML][cxml] by taking the DOM returned
by the HTML5 parser and serializing it to SAX events.

     (defun html->xhtml (html)
       (html5-sax:serialize-dom (html5-parser:parse-html5 html)
                                (cxml:make-string-sink)))

HTML5-SAX understands namespaces, the `lang` attribute, and the `base`
element, and handles the corner cases where XML is more strict than
HTML.

It also replaces `chtml:make-string-sink` for serialization:

     (stp:serialize dom (html5-sax:make-html5-sink))

This produces an HTML5 document with a UTF-8 charset declaration.

HTML5-SAX also extends `html5-parser:parse-html5` directly:

    (html5-parser:parse-html5 source :dom :cxml-stp)

It adds support for CXMLâ€™s [DOM][dom] (as `:cxml-dom`), [STP][stp] (as
`:cxml-stp`), [XMLS][xmls] (as `:cxml-xmls`), and direct serialization
to XHTML (as `:xhtml`)).
